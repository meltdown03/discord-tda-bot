Set you discord bot secret api key as an evironment variable named "DC_TOKEN", and get your Discord user
ID by right-clicking on your name and click "Copy ID". Set it as "DC_ID"
Note: You can also use a .env file if running in a pipenv/venv.

You should have your TDA API's Client ID, Account Number, and Redirect URL handy as well. The bot will ask
for these in a DM. It will also open a webpage to login/authorize the app via the TDA website on the first
run.
